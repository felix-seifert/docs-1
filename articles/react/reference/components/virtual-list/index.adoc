= Virtual List

Virtual List allows you to render a long list of items inside a scrollable container without sacrificing performance. Each item is rendered on the fly as the user scrolls the list.

To use the component, you need to assign it a set of data items and a renderer that’s used to render each individual data item. The height of an item is determined by its content and can change dynamically.

This code line generates some data to be used in the example:

[source,typescript]
----
const data = Array.from(Array(100).keys()).map(i => ({ index: i, value: '◯'.repeat(i) }));
----

Then, you can create a virtual list like this one:

[source,typescript]
----
<VirtualList items={data} renderer={({ item }) => <span>{item.value}</span>} />
----
