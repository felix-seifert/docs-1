Azure Kit lets you quickly deploy your Vaadin application to Microsoft's Azure Cloud.
Azure Kit is based on Kubernetes Kit, which means that all the features of Kubernetes Kit are also available in Azure Kit. This means that both Kits enable the following:

- Non-disruptive rolling updates that don't interrupt user sessions, reducing the cost and inconvenience of after-hours deployments. 
- Horizontal scalability, saving on cloud costs by allowing your application to scale down without impacting active users' sessions, and scale up when needed.
- High availability, enabling users to keep their active sessions and continue using your application even if a server fails.
- “serialization helpers” that make it faster and easier to fully leverage horizontal scaling and fail-over.

In addition to these features, Azure Kit has the added benefit of facilitating the deployment of your application to Azure Cloud. Azure Kit does this by providing a set of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates you can use to deploy your application to Azure Cloud.
These templates are based on the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters.
