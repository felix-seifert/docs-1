= Deploying a Vaadin Flow Application on Azure

In this final chapter in the series, you learn how to deploy a Spring Boot application on https://azure.microsoft.com[Azure].
In the tutorial we will use Azure Container Apps for its simplicity. 
For a larger scale deployment and best possible end user experience, consider using Azure Kubernetes Service together with https://vaadin.com/clustering[Vaadin Kubernets Kit].

This chapter covers:

* Vaadin production builds.
* Packaging Vaadin app as a Docker image.
* Deploying Docker packaged web app using Azure Container Apps.
* Tips for production deployment.

.Vaadin can be deployed on any cloud provider
[TIP]
From Cloud providers point of view, Vaadin is standard Java Web application. You can deploy your application onto pretty much any cloud platform, in many different ways.
Read the <<{articles}/production/cloud-providers#, Cloud Deployment tutorials>> for more options.

== Preparing the Application for Production

It's important to build a separate production-optimized version of the application before deploying it.
In development mode, Vaadin has a live-reload widget, debug logging, and uses a quick, but unoptimized, frontend build that includes source maps for easy debugging, that is maintained using npm and Vite.
Unoptimized frontend bundles can contain several megabytes of JavaScript and dependecies, that are not needed during production deployment.

The [filename]`pom.xml` file includes a `production` profile configuration that prepares an optimized build which is ready for production.

== Deployment using Azure Container Apps

To use Azure Container Apps, you'll need to install Docker (for example using https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker Desktop]) and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli[Azure CLI]. Also, make sure you have an active Azure account. 

First, ensure you have logged in:

[source,bash]
----
az login
----

Docker image is a basic building block used by many modern hosting solutions to run your application, including Azure Container App that we are using in this example. 
The example project contains a simple ready made Dockerfile that essentially describes how the application should be run.

Azure Container Apps contains handy `up` command, that does lot of convention based setup for Docker based deployments. With a single command, Azure tooling builds a Docker image, pushes it to a registry and creates a single node deployment based on it.

[source,bash]
----
az containerapp up -n my-crm-app --source .
----

The docker build and deployment may take a while, depending on the speed of your computure and network. At the end of the output you should see the address to your newly deployd Vaadin application.

.Avoid data loss
[WARNING]
====
This application uses in-memory H2 database, which is handy for development. The database is re-created on each deployment and is embedded for each node. For an actual usage, you should switch to your preferred database (at least in the production profile), use `ddl-auto=none` and start to use a database migration tool like https://www.liquibase.org/[Liquibase] or https://flywaydb.org/[Flyway], so you can evolve the database schema without losing data. Check Spring & Azure docs for more.

== Conclusion and Next Steps

Congratulations.
You have now built a full-stack web app in pure Java and deployed it to Azure.
